# FSND-Game-API-P7
Nanodegree Project: Backend API Service for the game of War

### Set-Up Instructions:
1.  Update the value of application in app.yaml to the app ID you have registered
in the App Engine admin console and would like to use to host your instance of this sample.
2.  Run the app with the devserver using dev_appserver.py DIR, and ensure it's
running by visiting the API Explorer - by default `localhost:8080/_ah/api/explorer`.
3.  (Optional) Generate your client library(ies) with the endpoints tool.
Deploy your application.

While launching chrome to test your API, you will have to launch it using the console as follows: `[path-to-Chrome] --user-data-dir=test --unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure=http://localhost:port`

### Game Description:
War is a card game typically involving two players - a human player and a bot. It uses a standard playing card deck. However, the app will only use 26 cards to keep the game short.

The objective of the game is to win all the cards.

The deck is divided evenly among the two players. In unison, each player reveals the top card of their deck – this is a "battle" – and the player with the higher card takes both of the cards played and adds them to their deck. Aces are high, and suits are ignored.

If the two cards played are of equal value, then there is a "war". Both players place the next card from their deck face down in a pool and battle with the next top card of their deck. The higher face-up card wins the war and adds all six cards to the bottom of their deck. If the face-up cards are again equal then the battle repeats with another set of cards. This repeats until one player's face-up card is higher than their opponent's. A player will lose if their deck is empty or runs out of cards during a war.
